# Gen-AI-Multi-Agent-LangChain
**Purpose:** build and run a dynamic and interactive multi-agent simulation using LangChain.


# What I Learned:
- Introduction to Generative Agents: I learned about generative agents, their importance, and how to set up my environment.
- Building Generative Agents: I understood the role of memory in generative agents, implemented my first generative agent, and interacted with it. I also set up and ran my first multi-agent simulation, including a challenge to run a generative agent trivia night.
- Modeling Complex Scenarios: I implemented dialogue agent and simulator classes, explored different speaker selection methods, and simulated scenarios like a startup pitch to investors.
- Equipping Agents with Tools: I learned about various agent tools in LangChain, enabled agents to access these tools, and simulated a debate with tool integration.

# Skills I Applied:
- Application Development: Building and running dynamic and interactive multiagent simulations.
- LangChain: Using this AI-powered framework to create and manage generative agents.
- Generative AI: Understanding and implementing generative models and scenarios.
